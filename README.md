## ⚙️ How It Works

The extension enhances your ChatGPT experience through:

- **Message Collapse**  
  Automatically collapses assistant responses and previews user messages for quick scanning.

- **Interactive Controls**  
  Each message gets a **"Show More" / "Show Less"** toggle, making long threads manageable.

- **Add to Card**  
  Important responses can be **saved into a persistent “Card” section**—great for bookmarking key info or reusable prompts.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  A `MutationObserver` tracks updates to the conversation and dynamically applies all functionality.

- **Performance Friendly**  
  Designed to minimize DOM updates and keep the page smooth, even during large conversations.
